### Day1:

Done, now with file readage! :heavy_check_mark:

### Day2:

The processing works, and now reads from a file.\
Reading from the file actually made it easier XD\
Code passes both tests

### Day3:

a-file solves first part of the puzzle, reads input from file.\
b-file solves second part, read input from file.\
-1 file is the same as the other two, but using lists and more methods.

### Day4:

a-file solves both part, reads secret from file.\
To solve second part, add a 0 to the comparison value. Takes a couple of minutes to run.

### Day 5:

a-file solves part one, reads file\
b-file solves second part, woo :tada: :confetti_ball:
